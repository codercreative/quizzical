### Project overview

This is a React web application trivia game. It is the final solo project as part of Scrimba's Front End Developer course.

### Overview of steps

- Consult Figma design files
- Create files/components
- Main CSS styles
- Import Google Font - Karla and Inter
- Figure out how to click on button and get a brand new page
- Import OTDB API with fetch and React.useEffect()
- React.useState()
- Display 5 questions with possible answers
- Make sure the correct answer is shuffled among the incorrect answers
- Decode HTML entities with https://cdnjs.com/libraries/he
- Highlight the user's guessed answer in blue
- Display results: The correct and incorrect answers in green and pink, respectively
- Display how many answers are correct
- Display a play again button
- Add yellow and blue "blobs" to the background

### Challenges:

#### Had a problem viewing all the questions and answers in mobile view. I removed the `height: 100vh` in main.

#### I needed the h1 to be placed further down on the start page and then a bit higher on the quiz and answer interfaces, so I changed the h1 to h2 on for the quiz / answer interfaces

#### I had to make sure that the answers from the API didn't appear at the end every time. It is necessary to randomize the placement of the answers for it to be a true game ðŸ˜…

```js
// UseEffect hook fetching trivia questions from the opentdb.com API
React.useEffect(() => {
  fetch("https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=5")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      const triviaWithShuffledAnswers = data.results.map((question) => ({
        ...question,
        answers: shuffleAnswers(
          question.incorrect_answers,
          question.correct_answer
        ),
      }));
      setTrivia(triviaWithShuffledAnswers);
      setLoading(false);
    });
}, []);

//Function to shuffle correct and incorrect answers to provide randomized answer choices
function shuffleAnswers(incorrect, correct) {
  const allAnswers = [...incorrect, correct];
  return allAnswers.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
}
```
